# Cohesion : A place of trust and competence using Blockchain Hyperldeger Fabric

Achieve a trusted "place of competence" using the blockchain. The idea was to create a platform that would allow people in a company to enter their "extra-professional" skills and make them available on the platform in order to offer help but also to receive it. 
To realize a solution to this use case we were instructed to use Hyperledger. Hyperledger is a private, open source blockchain. It is the most complete private blockchain on the market, but it is also one of the most complex to deploy.
